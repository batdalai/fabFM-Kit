This is the example Arduino sketch that runs on the atmega328. Use Arduino Pro (3.3V, 8HMz) for the board selection in arduino. 

DO NOT use the 'Burn Bootloader' command in Arduino, since those use different fuses.

The Si4703 Library needs to be used and can be found [here](https://dlnmh9ip6v2uc.cloudfront.net/tutorialimages/fabfm/Si4703_Breakout.zip).
